        <h3>ECO_s394D_Summer2024</h3>
        <p>This repository contains assignments and code implementations for ECO_s394D Summer 2024 course. The assignments are based on the tutorial "Data Science in R: A Gentle Introduction" by Professor James Scott. The repository includes R Markdown files for homework assignments, scripts organized by lessons covering topics from basic R programming to statistical inference, data visualization, and data wrangling.</p>

        <h3>PRE_datatask2024</h3>
        <p>This repository contains code for data processing exercises completed as part of the Pre-Doctoral Research in Economics (PRE) Workshop. The data analysis was conducted under the guidance of mentor Colleen Faherty. The project includes R Markdown files and data processing scripts for various economic research tasks.</p>

        <h3>Revealed Preference</h3>
        <p>A Python-based toolkit for analyzing revealed preference theory. This project implements methods for testing and analyzing consumer choice behavior using revealed preference axioms such as WARP (Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference) and GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference).</p>

        <h3>Zone-SOC-Time Network Generator</h3>
        <p>This repository provides a generator for constructing a zone–state-of-charge (SOC)–time network, designed to model electric vehicle operations across spatial locations, time periods, and battery levels, enabling simulation of charging, waiting, service, and dispatch processes within transportation and mobility systems.</p>
